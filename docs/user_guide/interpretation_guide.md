## Understanding Your Results

### Key Output Metrics

When your analysis is complete, Bio Hit Finder provides several important metrics for each well:

#### Primary Activity Metrics

| Metric | Range | Good Values | Concerning Values | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Ratio_lptA** | 0.1 - 1.0 | 0.4 - 0.7 | < 0.2 (potential hit) | Lower = more inhibition |
| **Ratio_ldtD** | 0.1 - 1.0 | 0.4 - 0.6 | < 0.2 (potential hit) | Lower = more inhibition |
| **Z_lptA** | -5 to +5 | -2 to +2 | < -2 or > +2 | Standardized deviation |
| **Z_ldtD** | -5 to +5 | -2 to +2 | < -2 or > +2 | Standardized deviation |

#### Viability and Growth Metrics

| Metric | Range | Good Values | Concerning Values | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **OD_WT_norm** | 0.1 - 3.0 | 0.7 - 1.3 | < 0.5 | Growth relative to median |
| **OD_tolC_norm** | 0.1 - 3.0 | 0.7 - 1.3 | < 0.5 | Growth relative to median |
| **OD_SA_norm** | 0.1 - 3.0 | 0.7 - 1.3 | < 0.5 | Growth relative to median |
| **Viability_Gate** | TRUE/FALSE | TRUE | FALSE | Passed minimum viability |

### Statistical Confidence Levels

Understanding the statistical significance of your hits:

#### Z-Score Interpretation

| Z-Score Range | Statistical Significance | Biological Confidence | Action |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| \|Z\| < 1.5 | Not significant (p > 0.13) | Low confidence | Likely inactive |
| 1.5 ≤ \|Z\| < 2.0 | Borderline (p = 0.05-0.13) | Moderate confidence | Consider for validation |
| 2.0 ≤ \|Z\| < 3.0 | Significant (p = 0.003-0.05) | High confidence | Strong candidate |
| \|Z\| ≥ 3.0 | Highly significant (p < 0.003) | Very high confidence | Priority compound |

#### False Discovery Rate (FDR)

For large screens, consider the false discovery rate:

- **5% FDR**: Expect ~5% of identified hits to be false positives
- **10% FDR**: More permissive, ~10% false positives expected
- **1% FDR**: Very stringent, ~1% false positives expected

## Biological Context

### The lptA/ldtD System

Understanding what your targets do helps interpret results:

#### lptA (Lipopolysaccharide Transport Protein A)

**Function**: Essential for transporting LPS to the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria

**Biological Significance**:
- Critical for bacterial outer membrane integrity
- Essential gene in most Gram-negative bacteria
- Attractive target for novel antibiotics

**Expected Hit Profile**:
- **Strong hits**: Complete loss of reporter activity (Ratio < 0.2)
- **Moderate hits**: Partial inhibition (Ratio 0.2-0.4)
- **Resistance mechanism**: Efflux or target modification

#### ldtD (L,D-Transpeptidase D)

**Function**: Catalyzes peptidoglycan cross-linking, particularly under stress conditions

**Biological Significance**:
- Important for cell wall integrity under stress
- Contributes to antibiotic resistance
- Non-essential but conditionally important

**Expected Hit Profile**:
- **Strong hits**: Significant reduction in reporter activity
- **Moderate hits**: Partial activity reduction
- **Context-dependent**: Activity may vary with growth conditions

### Strain-Specific Responses

#### Wild-Type (WT) Strain
- **Baseline**: Reference strain with all intact systems
- **Interpretation**: Represents "normal" bacterial response
- **Low OD**: General growth inhibition or cytotoxicity

#### ΔtolC Strain (Efflux Deficient)
- **Purpose**: Lacks major efflux pump, increases compound sensitivity
- **Interpretation**: Enhanced activity suggests efflux-mediated resistance
- **Comparison**: WT vs. ΔtolC ratio indicates efflux involvement

#### SA (Slow-Growing) Strain  
- **Purpose**: Control for growth-rate effects
- **Interpretation**: Differential response suggests growth-dependent mechanisms
- **Comparison**: Helps distinguish specific vs. general growth effects

## Hit Interpretation

### Hit Categories and Biological Meaning

#### Strong Dual Hits (Both lptA and ldtD affected)
```
Z_lptA < -3.0 AND Z_ldtD < -3.0 AND Viability_Gate = TRUE
```

**Biological Interpretation**:
- Compound affects both pathways simultaneously
- Possible multi-target inhibitor
- May indicate general cellular stress response
- Could suggest membrane-active compound

**Prioritization**: **HIGH** - Dual-target inhibition is valuable

**Follow-up**: Test specificity, mechanism of action studies

#### Selective Strong Hits (Single target)
```
Z_lptA < -3.0 AND |Z_ldtD| < 1.5 (lptA-selective)
OR
Z_ldtD < -3.0 AND |Z_lptA| < 1.5 (ldtD-selective)  
```

**Biological Interpretation**:
- Specific inhibition of one pathway
- Suggests targeted mechanism
- Less likely to be cytotoxic artifact
- May have fewer side effects

**Prioritization**: **HIGH** - Selectivity is desirable for drug development

**Follow-up**: Confirm selectivity, SAR studies

#### Moderate Hits with Growth Effects
```
-3.0 < Z < -2.0 AND OD_norm < 0.7
```

**Biological Interpretation**:
- Partial pathway inhibition with growth impact
- May indicate cytostatic activity
- Could be concentration-dependent
- Might have therapeutic window

**Prioritization**: **MEDIUM** - Requires dose-response analysis

**Follow-up**: Concentration-response curves, viability assays

#### Hits Only in ΔtolC Strain
```
Compound shows activity in ΔtolC but not WT
```

**Biological Interpretation**:
- Compound is a substrate for TolC efflux pump
- Good cellular permeability and activity
- Activity masked by efflux in WT
- May need efflux pump inhibitor combination

**Prioritization**: **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Validates target engagement

**Follow-up**: Test with efflux pump inhibitors, membrane permeability studies

### Problematic Hit Patterns

#### Cytotoxic Compounds
```
Z_score significant BUT Viability_Gate = FALSE
```

**Interpretation**: Growth inhibition rather than specific pathway inhibition

**Decision**: Usually deprioritized unless cytotoxicity is desired

#### Edge-Only Hits
```
Hits concentrated in edge wells (rows A, H or columns 1, 12)
```

**Interpretation**: Likely artifact from edge effects, not true activity

**Decision**: Apply B-score correction or exclude from analysis

#### All-Strong Hits
```
>50% of compounds show strong activity
```

**Interpretation**: Possible assay problems, inappropriate controls, or very active library

**Decision**: Check assay quality, positive/negative controls, data processing

### Red Flags in Results

#### Statistical Red Flags
