# Scientific Background: Dual-Readout OM Permeabilization Screening

## The Challenge: Gram-Negative Outer Membrane Impermeability

Gram-negative bacteria pose a significant challenge to antibiotic treatment due to their distinctive outer membrane (OM) structure. The OM contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that create a formidable barrier, effectively repelling many antibiotic compounds and providing structural support to the bacterial cell envelope.

**Key Facts:**
- Many compounds with bacterial activity cannot penetrate the Gram-negative OM effectively
- LPS molecules arranged at the OM create both a physical and electrostatic barrier
- This impermeability is a major factor in antimicrobial resistance

## The Solution: Dual-Readout Reporter System

The BREAKthrough screening platform addresses this challenge through an innovative dual-readout approach that identifies compounds capable of disrupting the outer membrane barrier. The system uses two complementary biological reporters that respond specifically to OM destabilization.

### Reporter 1: lptA (LPS Transport Protein A)

**Biological Function:**
- LptA is the periplasmic bridge protein connecting inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane (OM) LPS transport complexes
- Essential component of the lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) system
- Links LptC (IM) to LptD/E (OM) for LPS translocation across the periplasm

**Stress Response:**
- Upregulated by σE sigma factor during envelope stress
- Specifically activated when LPS composition or biogenesis are negatively impacted
- **Important:** NOT upregulated during other σE stress conditions that don't involve OM perturbation

**Reporter Design:**
- lptA promoter fused with lacZ reporter gene
- BetaGlo substrate (6-O-β-galactopyranosyl-luciferin) cleaved by β-galactosidase
- Luminescence intensity reflects lptA expression level

### Reporter 2: ldtD (L,D-Transpeptidase D)

**Biological Function:**
- LdtD is a Cpx-regulated L,D-transpeptidase enzyme
- Forms 3-3 crosslinks in the peptidoglycan matrix
- Provides structural compensation when OM integrity is compromised

**Stress Response:**
- Induced under membrane stress conditions
- Forms 3-3 crosslinks to provide structural support in areas of LPS depletion/disassociation
- Part of the peptidoglycan remodeling response to OM assembly defects

**Reporter Design:**
- ldtD promoter fused with lacZ reporter gene
- Same BetaGlo detection system as lptA
- Expression indicates peptidoglycan stress response to OM damage

## Screening Rationale: Finding OM Permeabilizers

The dual-reporter system enables identification of compounds that cause outer membrane damage through two complementary mechanisms:

1. **Direct LPS Transport Disruption:** Detected by lptA upregulation
2. **Compensatory Structural Response:** Detected by ldtD upregulation

**Therapeutic Strategy:**
- Compounds that permeabilize the membrane without causing cell lysis can serve as adjuvants
- These "OM permeabilizers" can sensitize Gram-negative bacteria to existing antibiotics
- Combination therapy approach: OM permeabilizer + traditional antibiotic

## Vitality Screening: Three-Strain Growth Analysis

The platform incorporates a parallel vitality assay using three bacterial strains with different OM characteristics:

### Strain Selection:
1. **E. coli WT:** Intact outer membrane providing natural resistance
2. **E. coli ΔtolC:** Impaired OM with increased permeability (sensitized strain)
3. **S. aureus:** Gram-positive control with no outer membrane

### Growth Pattern Analysis:
True OM-disrupting compounds should show:
- **Minimal effect on E. coli WT** (>80% growth) - intact OM provides protection
- **Significant inhibition of E. coli ΔtolC** (≤80% growth) - compromised OM increases sensitivity
- **No effect on S. aureus** (>80% growth) - no OM target available

## Multi-Stage Hit Calling Pipeline

The screening platform employs a rigorous three-stage filtering approach:

### Stage 1: Reporter Hits
- **Criteria:** lptA OR ldtD Z-score ≥ 2.0 AND viable cells (ATP-based)
- **Interpretation:** Compounds triggering OM stress response
- **Biology:** Indicates disruption of LPS transport or peptidoglycan integrity

### Stage 2: Vitality Hits
- **Criteria:** OM-specific growth inhibition pattern (WT > 80%, ΔtolC ≤ 80%, SA > 80%)
- **Interpretation:** Compounds with OM-selective activity
- **Biology:** Confirms OM-specific mechanism rather than general cytotoxicity

### Stage 3: Platform Hits
- **Criteria:** Compounds satisfying BOTH reporter AND vitality criteria
- **Interpretation:** Validated OM permeabilizers with dual evidence
- **Biology:** High-confidence hits for adjuvant development

## Statistical Methodology: Robust Z-Scores

### Why Robust Statistics?

The screening platform uses robust Z-scores based on Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) rather than traditional mean/standard deviation approaches:

**Advantages:**
- **Outlier Resistance:** Strong hits cannot skew the baseline, overshadowing true hits
- **Non-Normal Distributions:** No assumption of Gaussian data distribution required
- **Plate-Specific:** Calculated per plate to account for day-to-day variability
- **Human Variation:** Accommodates operator differences and environmental factors

**Formula:**
```
Robust Z-score = (x - median) / (1.4826 × MAD)
```
Where MAD = Median Absolute Deviation, and 1.4826 is the consistency factor for normal distributions.

### Reagent Chemistry

**BetaGlo Assay (Reporter Detection):**
- Contains 6-O-β-galactopyranosyl-luciferin substrate
- β-galactosidase (from lacZ) cleaves substrate to release D-luciferin
- Firefly luciferase converts D-luciferin + ATP + O₂ → oxyluciferin + light
- Luminescence intensity proportional to β-galactosidase activity

**BacTiter Assay (Viability Detection):**
- Contains D-luciferin substrate (no ATP provided)
- Uses cellular ATP from viable bacteria
- Same luciferase reaction: luminescence indicates cell viability
- Ratio BG/BT normalizes reporter activity to viable cell count

## Expected Results and Validation

Based on screening of 880 crude microbial extracts:

**Typical Hit Rates:**
- **Reporter Hits (Stage 1):** ~8% of extracts (70/880)

- **Vitality Hits (Stage 2):** ~6.5% of extracts (57/880)
- **Platform Hits (Stage 3):** ~1% of extracts (9/880)

**Quality Control:**
